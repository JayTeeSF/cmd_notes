What will:
```scope :profile_id_for, ->(user_id) {
      where(user_id: user_id).pluck(:id).first
}```

return, if there is NO matching record in that table for the specified user_id?

(misleading) hint: typically (when there is a matching record for the user_id it returns the `id` of that row)

a) nil [which means nothing, in Ruby]
b) 42 [cuz, of course, thatâ€™s the universal answer]
c) EVERY record in that ENTIRE 2M row table

correct (crazy) answer, `c
