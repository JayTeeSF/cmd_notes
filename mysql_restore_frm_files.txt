in addition to sometimes having to delete:
/var/lib/mysql/ib*

you may also have to delete the .frm files for your database
/var/lib/mysql/<db>/*.frm

at which point the .ibd files have data, but you can't
see any tables.

so you have to re-run the table create statements:
bundle exec rails runner -e test 'p (ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables).each { |tbl| ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("show create table #{tbl}")}'
