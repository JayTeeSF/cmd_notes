# godoc is no longer part of core, so:
  go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc

brew install go
# add go to path
# You may wish to add the GOROOT-based install location to your PATH:
#   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.2.1/libexec/bin
mkdir -p ~/.godir/src
export GOPATH=~/.godir/src

# or elsewhere (see bash_login for aliases to re-set GOPATH and cd appropriately)

# trouble shooting (thx to: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-dev/ZWFCitgOD3E):
↪ go build
# brainscape.com/bsu
# ./aws.go:4: import /Users/jthomas/dev/bsu/pkg/darwin_amd64/launchpad.net/goamz/aws.a: object is [darwin amd64 go1.2.1 X:none] expected [darwin amd64 go1.3.3 X:precisestack]

# solution:
↪ go build -a
#then:
↪ go install -a

# The easiest way to update all packages in GOPATH is:
go install -a -v all

# so then I tried to clean ...and created a new mess:
go clean -a -x -v all

# that caused me to lose some dependencies, which led me to (line-by-line) run a script in our repo:
↪ more upd_libs.sh

#!/bin/sh
#go get -u launchpad.net/goamz/aws
#<-- failure because Bazaar (bzr) RCS (revision control software) isn't installed!
#  per: http://golang.org/s/gogetcmd
#  brew install bzr
#
#  then:
#  ↪ go get -u launchpad.net/goamz/aws
#  # cd /Users/jthomas/dev/bsu/src/launchpad.net/goamz; bzr pull --overwrite
#  bzr: ERROR: No such file: u'/Users/jthomas/dev/bsu/src/launchpad.net/goamz/.bzr/repository/upload/isvri92uw2kusqrpe8u8.pack': [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/Users/jthomas/dev/bsu/src/launchpad.net/goamz/.bzr/repository/upload/isvri92uw2kusqrpe8u8.pack'
#  Using saved parent location: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~goamz/goamz/trunk/
#  package launchpad.net/goamz/aws: exit status 3
#
#  so I made the missing dir:
#  ↪ mkdir -p /Users/jthomas/dev/bsu/src/launchpad.net/goamz/.bzr/repository/upload
#  ...and it worked:
#  ↪ go get -u launchpad.net/goamz/aws
#
#go get -u launchpad.net/goamz/ec2
#go get -u launchpad.net/goamz/iam
#go get -u launchpad.net/goamz/s3
