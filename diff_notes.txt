git diff -w
like
hg diff -w

are my favorite diff formats
...they don't waste my time with simple space-changes
and they can be piped to gitx for easy reading

That said, for new files and just shell work --assuming I ever worked
without being in a repo (!?)-- you can use:
diff -u

moreover, to look at a newly created file
diff -u <(cat /dev/null) <new_file>

e.g.
diff -u <(cat /dev/null) new_file.txt
