git diff -w
like
hg diff -w

are my favorite diff formats
...they don't waste my time with simple space-changes
and they can be piped to gitx for easy reading

# thx to das-0008-processes-and-jobs.mov
That said, for new files and just shell work --assuming I ever worked
without being in a repo (!?)-- you can use:
diff -u

moreover, to look at a newly created file
diff -u <(cat /dev/null) <new_file>

e.g.
diff -u <(cat /dev/null) new_file.txt

usecase for diff of diffs
one branch with a range of commits
another branch with squashed commits

and you want to know if they're the same (i.e. no difference) ...or not

diff -u <(git diff master~5..master~1) <(git diff master~4..master) | view -

# compare to websites (by curling in sub-processes)
diff -u <(curl www.google.com | tidy) <(curl www.google.fr | tidy) | view -

# better yet, compare local webserver with the production one:
diff -u <(curl www.brainscape.com | tidy) <(curl localhost:3000 | tidy) | view -
