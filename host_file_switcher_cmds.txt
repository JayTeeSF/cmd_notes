Setup hostFile Switching:

(1) auto-mount the Public volume when you log in:
- In the Finder, hit Command+k to open the "Connect to Server" dialog.
- Enter "smb://10.33.5.3/", click Connect, and authenticate with the first-part of your affinitylabs.com email username & password.
(i.e. <first_part>@affinity... / pwd )
- Go to Apple Menu -> System Preferences -> Accounts, select your account, and click Login Items.
- Click "+" to add a login item and navigate to the "10.33.5.3" shared server, and select the "Public" volume.

(2) Setup an alias, for the "host-file switcher" cmd (note: this will essentially replace your /etc/hosts file -- backup, if you want):
Add the following to your .profile (or .bashrc, etc...):
alias h='/Volumes/Public/hosts/gethosts.sh'

How to use it:

> h
followed by "prd" will restore a default host-file to your machine -- however, it does NOT actually restore your original host file (so backup, if necessary)

on the other hand, if you choose "pre" then visit any site (e.g. admin.insidetech.com:8080), you should notice a red "preview" div in the upper left-hand-side (LHS) of your screen -- mouse-over in order to determine the (SVN-)release running on the preview server...

FYI: add the following alias in order to flush your DNS cache:
alias f='dscacheutil -flushcache'
