convert wmv to imovie compatible videos with:
ffmpeg -i input.wmv -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a libfaac -q:a 100 output.mp4

Gory Details (in case that page no longer exists):
You can use FFmpeg (a free command-line tool for Mac, Linux and Windows) to encode WMV to MP4. Here is an example syntax:

ffmpeg -i input.wmv -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a libfaac -q:a 100 output.mp4
This will encode the video to H.264 video and AAC audio, using the default quality. To change the quality for the video, use a different CRF value, where lower means better, e.g. 20 or 18. For audio, 100% is the default quality. Increase the value for better quality.

For the AppleTV specifically, this is what Apple says it supports:

H.264 video up to 1080p, 30 frames per second, High or Main Profile level 4.0 or lower, Baseline profile level 3.0 or lower with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps per channel, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats

So, you could use the following command to force the 30 Hz frame rate and High profile:

ffmpeg -i input.wmv -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -profile:v high -r 30 -c:a libfaac -q:a 100 -ar 48000 output.mp4

I just tried using this solution on Fedora 19 and ran into the error: Unknown encoder 'libaac' It seems that after a certain release, ffmpeg does not include binary distibutions with libfaac support, so you would need to build from source. Instead I changed 'libfaac' to 'aac' and added the '-strict -2' flags and the conversion worked successfully. –  roartechs Jan 6 at 8:10
