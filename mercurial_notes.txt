# CHERRY PICK to production:

  235  hg update -C production
  236  hg transplant 6b0bfe7d73375ea00155c24922c35d85a783b731 # move my staging commit (that's on bitbucket) to the (bitbucket) production branch


# hg shelve <-- git stash equivalent:

shelved as LEFTOFF
3 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved

# then:
↪ hg unshelve


# thx to Joel Spolsky:
# my "main" local copy of the repo is in my brain-scape.com directory, so I clone it:
hg clone brain-scape.com brain-scape.com-diff

# now I can work on a different "branch" within the "brain-scape.com-diff" directory
# sometimes this (which relies on hardlinks for space efficiency) is better than making "permanent" branches in the mercurial repo
# Instead, I can just have mutliple "working-directories"

# after merging the current branch with default, do a diff:
hg diff -r default

# and like git strip whitespace changes:
hg diff -w -r default

# more over, you can pipe the output to gitx
hg diff -w -r default | gitx

# it seems that I'm the only one creating "randomly named" mercurial branches.
# Am I doing it wrong?  (From what I read it looks like mercurial branches can't be deleted.)

# you can close branches in mercurial:
hg commit --close-branch -m "replaced with newer version rebased off default"
#or
hg commit --close-branch -m "merged to default"
# will mark the branch as closed

###
hg pull # doesn't update working-dir
hg merge
hg branch my-branch
hg add
hg commit -m "..."
hg push -f #if I'm creating my branch on mercurial
hg update -C default # go back to default -- like git checkout

# then, merge my branch to default... # tb-figured-out

# abort a merge:
hg update -C .

# then push default...
