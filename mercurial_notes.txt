# after merging the current branch with default, do a diff:
hg diff -r default

# and like git strip whitespace changes:
hg diff -w -r default

# more over, you can pipe the output to gitx
hg diff -w -r default | gitx

###

# it seems that I'm the only one creating "randomly named" mercurial branches.
# Am I doing it wrong?  (From what I read it looks like mercurial branches can't be deleted.)

# you can close branches in mercurial:
hg commit --close-branch -m "replaced with newer version rebased off default"
# will mark the branch as closed

###
hg pull # doesn't update working-dir
hg merge
hg branch my-branch
hg add
hg commit -m "..."
hg push -f #if I'm creating my branch on mercurial
hg update -C default # go back to default -- like git checkout

# then, merge my branch to default... # tb-figured-out

# abort a merge:
hg update -C .

# then push default...
