normal:
mysql -uroot -ppwd database_name < ./db_file.sql

The 'new' hotness:
cat ./db_file.sql | pv -cN MYSQL | mysql -uroot database_name -ppwd

The first one makes you wait an indefinite amount of time ...unsure as to whether or not your db is hung.
The second one, at least, lets you know that something is flowing...

Even better, still:
time cat ./db_file.sql | pv -cN MYSQL | mysql -uroot database_name -ppwd

...that way you know how long it actually took
