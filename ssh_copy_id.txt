# issue, don't want to keep typing your password to ssh to a system
# don't want to have to cat ~/.ssh/id.pub | pbcopy
# and then ssh to the server and paste that id to 
# ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# instead use one cmd:
brew install ssh-copy-id

ssh-copy-id <user>@<host>
password: <-- type your password one last time :-)
