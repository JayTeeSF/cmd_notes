My machine crashed and MySQL wouldn't start, i.e.:
  Starting MySQL
  .. ERROR! Manager of pid-file quit without updating file.


According to Google I should trim-down my /usr/local/etc/my.cnf until I find the problem. But since I knew my issue was one of corruption -- and not some bogus setting -- I just wanted a quick solution (e.g. remove/re-install)


Also, because I used brew, to install mysql (yes, mac osx) my "data" directory (unlabeled) was located in:
  /usr/local/var/mysql

There I found the key file: <hostname>.err
( Oddity I had many, because DHCP changes (pron: confuses) my system's hostname all the time. Nevertheless...)

InnoDB: It is also possible that this is a temporary table #sql...,

InnoDB: Please refer to

So, I just blew-away that chemistry_light directory, and all was well...

...or so I thought!
Apparently mysql wasn't happy anytime I tried to recreate that database or it's entities (tables, etc)
