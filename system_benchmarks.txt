# Situation: Two employees systems' were completing our app's specs in wildly different times.

# Motiating Question: How are their systems different (i.e. memory/cpu or software)?

# Key insight came from comparing:
# Ruby Perf:
time ruby -e "count = 0; while(count < 100000000); count = count + 1;
end; puts count"

# Shell Perf:
time bash -c 'i=0;while [ $i -le 1000000 ]; do i=$(($i+1)); done; echo $i;'

# Perl Perf:
time perl -e '$count = 0; while ($count < 10000000) { $count ++; } print $count;'

# Given that Shell & Perl tests ran in the same/similar times, it was
# easy to resolve:

# Solution: recompile Ruby with proper cflags (see rvm cflags)
