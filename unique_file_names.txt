# in Ruby you can
require 'tempfile'
new_file = Tempfile.new(name, tmp_dir)
# to create a uniquely named temporary file in a directory of your choosing

# however, as soon as you remove all references to that object
new_file = nil

# Ruby will (eventually) garbage collect & remove the file!

# SO, if you want to create a uniquely named file that you can, for example, persists across processes, try:

file_path =  Dir::Tmpname.create( name, tmp_dir ) {}
