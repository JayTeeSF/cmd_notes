For compiling in support of other apps (e.g. tk)
append: -C --enable-shared,--enable-pthread
e.g.
rvm install 1.9.2 -C --enable-shared,--enable-pthread
#actually:
rvm install ree --enable-pthread

# also try:
# gem install tk_as_gem #<-- I don't think this was needed

#If you're using RVM, then you can do this to remove current ruby gems, then upgrade/downgrade rubygems:
# rvm install rubygems 1.3.6
# this is great, since I broke my system by upgrading ruby!!!
