‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú© PEAR ‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©

If PEAR complains about permissions, 'fix' the default PEAR permissions and config:
    chmod -R ug+w /usr/local/Cellar/php56/5.6.6/lib/php
    pear config-set php_ini /usr/local/etc/php/5.6/php.ini system

‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú© Extensions ‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©

If you are having issues with custom extension compiling, ensure that
you are using the brew version, by placing /usr/local/bin before /usr/sbin in your PATH:

      PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

PHP56 Extensions will always be compiled against this PHP. Please install them
using --without-homebrew-php to enable compiling against system PHP.

‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú© PHP CLI ‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©

If you wish to swap the PHP you use on the command line, you should add the following to ~/.bashrc,
~/.zshrc, ~/.profile or your shell's equivalent configuration file:

      export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php56)/bin:$PATH"

‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú© FPM ‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©‚ú©

To launch php-fpm on startup:
    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    cp /usr/local/opt/php56/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist

The control script is located at /usr/local/opt/php56/sbin/php56-fpm

OS X 10.8 and newer come with php-fpm pre-installed, to ensure you are using the brew version you need to make sure /usr/local/sbin is before /usr/sbin in your PATH:

  PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

You may also need to edit the plist to use the correct "UserName".

Please note that the plist was called 'homebrew-php.josegonzalez.php56.plist' in old versions
of this formula.

To have launchd start php56 at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/php56/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load php56 now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist

==> Caveats
Note that this formula will NOT install mysql. It is not
required since you might want to get connected to a remote
database server.

Webserver configuration example (add this at the end of
your /etc/apache2/httpd.conf for instance) :
  Alias /phpmyadmin /usr/local/share/phpmyadmin
  <Directory /usr/local/share/phpmyadmin/>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>

    </IfModule>
    <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
    </IfModule>
  </Directory>
Then, open http://localhost/phpmyadmin
