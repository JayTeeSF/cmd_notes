details on how-to connect with Ruby, here: http://datastax.github.io/ruby-driver/

require 'cassandra'
start by: connecting to cassandra (defaults to current host) => cluster = Cassandra.connect
create a 'keyspace' (arbitrary string name ...this step is apparently optional) => keyspace = "foo"
then connect the cluster to the keyspace => session = cluster.connect(keyspace)
at which point you can execute queries against the session session.execute_...("SELECT ...")

# driver (hopefully instead of python cqlsh): http://datastax.github.io/ruby-driver/

# ensure key directories are setup (and I know where they are):
#     
#    data_file_directories: /usr/local/var/lib/cassandra/data #probably defaults to: /usr/local/var/lib/cassandra/data
#     commitlog_directory: /usr/local/var/lib/cassandra/commitlog # probably defaults to: /usr/local/var/lib/cassandra/commitlog
#
# If not set, the default directory is $CASSANDRA_HOME/data/saved_caches.
# saved_caches_directory: /usr/local/var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches # probably defaults to: /usr/local/var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches

# per the system.log (in /usr/local/var/log/cassandra/):
# To create keyspaces and column families, see 'help create' in cqlsh.

cuz cassandra -f told me to
(sadly, I ran the launchctl cmds before trying cassandra -f by hand)

### install:
↪ brew install cassandra
==> Downloading http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/cassandra/2.1.0/apache-cassandra-2.1.0-bin.tar

==> Caveats
If you plan to use the CQL shell (cqlsh), you will need the Python CQL library
installed. Since Homebrew prefers using pip for Python packages, you can
install that using:

  pip install cql

To have launchd start cassandra at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/cassandra/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load cassandra now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.cassandra.plist
