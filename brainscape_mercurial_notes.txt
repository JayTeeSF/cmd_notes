Work on your own Topic Branch. When you're done, merge that branch after
all tests pass:
# Note: at this point you might want to (first) merge the default branch
into your topic branch
# similar to:
http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2011/02/01/three-simple-mercurial-rules/
hg pull
hg update -C topic_branch

hg merge default
hg commit -Am "merging default"
hg push -b . # append --new-branch, only if it's a new branch

# After which you can:
hg update -C default
hg merge topic_branch
hg update topic_branch
hg commit -Am "merging jt_controller_specs_2" --close-branch #remove the
topic-branch
hg push -b .
