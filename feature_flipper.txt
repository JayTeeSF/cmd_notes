to flip a feature
checkout config/initializers/redis_feature_flipper.rb
it creates an instance of the Feature, and passes it to the flipper
We then:
(a) create a constant in supported.rb
# behind the scenes flipper loads these constants
# flipper then has enable, disable and enabled?(feature-constant) method(s)
# for turning features on, off, and informing you of their state...

in your code use your constant like so:
Feature.enabled?(Feature::MYFEATURE)
  do something;
end
