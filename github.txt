find out what changed from one version to the next
(1) goto repo
(2) under the "Branches" button, find the tags
(3) goto the older tag
(4) modify the url (change "/tree" to "compare" ...make it look like this:
https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/compare/v2.9.0...v2.10.0
(see all the commits between those two versions.)
(4*) correction:
the "v" part of the tag may not be used (at least on some repos):
https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/compare/2.13.5...2.14.1
however, older tags w/ dashes seem to require it:
https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/compare/v2-5-3...2.13.5
