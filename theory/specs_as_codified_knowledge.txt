(borrowing from ???) suggests the following approach to learning a new
library:
(1) download library
(2) read docs
(3) write your own specs ...in order to exercise the code and see it do
what the docs "claim"

(4) save those specs

later [ when version2 comes-out ]
(a) download the new library
(b) run your specs against it
(c) as opposed to reading (inevitably) partial "release notes", simply
look for spec failures!
