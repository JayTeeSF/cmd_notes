SubscriptionBilling
id, user_id, receipt (apple 64bit/stripe_token), gateway(Apple/Google/Stripe), term, plan, created_at, canceled_at, next_renewal_at, refunded_at

However, keep a separate (read-only) history table:

Subscription(History/Current):
id, user_id, subscription_id, plan(trial,premium,etc), started_at (current month), stopped_at(next month)

before sending to the client perform all the calculations and augment the JSON:
api_version: ...
subscription_expiration: stopped_at.to_i - Time.now.to_i #how many seconds left
cache_expiration: 3600 # # of seconds till the client has to ask again.
