don't mock the object you're testing
don't test each method
instead, test functionality
...what should happen (regardless of the particular implementation)
i.e. Given I have X, when I change Y, I should see Z increase...

Write _that_ test, don't check that 'last50uploads' got called ...instead, check that the file got uploaded.
