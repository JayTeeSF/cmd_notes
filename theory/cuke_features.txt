one feature file per feature
this makes fixing a particular feature easy.
The contrast is, when you're given:
FeatureA
  Given I blah
  When I bloo
  Then I blee

And instead of creating a FeatureB file you simply:
FeatureA
  Given I Blah
  When I bloo
  And I blooblah # feature-B is tested
  Then I blee

The problem is, if featureA needs to change, you can no longer "freely" modify FeatureA's file
cuz you don't know which other features are _only_ being tested by through this feature
...it's tough to tell if the "And I blooblah" line is just cruft ..
