read-only from outside the object
attr_readers == Good
attr_accessors == Bad (for anything other than internal-class methods, and/or spec-tests i.e. modifying an object that is not directly being tested)

Obj.data = true
add:
Obj.activates_data
...so that future biz-logic updates only need to be added in ONE piece of code: DRY
