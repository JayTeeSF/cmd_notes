# Issue: wanted to install (old) Mysql5.1 on my mac (for Zoodles tests to pass):

brew install
https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/master/mysql51.rb

# follow the instructions:
unset TMPDIR

# not sure if it’s necessary, but I created the missing socket:
ls -lrt /tmp/mysql.sock
touch /tmp/mysql.sock

# At which point I performed the second instruction:
/usr/local/Cellar/mysql51/5.1.73/bin/mysql_install_db

# See if it's running:
ps -eafwww | grep mysql

# IF not, start it (per the instructions):
cd /usr/local/Cellar/mysql51/5.1.73 ; /usr/local/Cellar/mysql51/5.1.73/bin/mysqld_safe &

# Update your PATH (env-var):
/usr/local/Cellar/mysql51/5.1.73/bin

# ensure you can connect:
mysql -uroot


# Creativity:

# install the current version of mysql:
brew install mysql

#It shouldn't 'brew link' cuz the old version is currently setup & running

# then link the 51 files and brew switch:
cd /usr/local/Cellar/mysql
ln -s ../mysql51/5.1.73 .

brew switch mysql 5.1.73

# if you already had Rails setup:
cdw # alias for cd’ing to my <rails_root> directory

gem uninstall mysql2

# then reinstall:
bundle install
# re-create all db's for rails
cdw # alias for cd’ing to my <rails_root> directory
rake db:create:all

# migrate all dbs for rails
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=staging rake db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=test rake db:migrate
rake db:migrate

# get staging data (for dev-env):
./script/development/import
