Download the 
 o  TideSDK Developer (console app)
 o  TideSDK API (the zip file that has 3 top level dirs: sdk, modules, ???)

The challenge: where to put the SDK stuff
move it to /Library/Application\ Support/TideSDK
(old articles online refer to 
"/Library/Application Support/Titanium" directory
and the
tibuild.py (command)

But the new command is: tidebuilder.py

Simply type:
python tidebuilder.py --dest=. --type=bundle /Users/jthomas/dev/TideSDK/desktop

# updated cmd:
python ~/TideSDK/sdk/osx/1.3.1-beta/tidebuilder.py --dest=/Users/jthomas/Desktop/ --type=bundle /Users/jthomas/dev/kidmode

Which means:
 create the .app bundle in the current (dest) directory
 make it of type "bundle" (vs. their old (paid) network/cloud option)
 and then supply the path to the root of your app's folder
