To view annotated tags you can use the same -l option as before, but you have to instruct git to show the annotation messages as well:
git tag -l -n1
This will not only show the messages for the annotated tags, it will also show the commit message of the revisions tagged with lightweight tags as well. Quite useful!


git tag -a -m "Tagging first full mixer release" v0.0.1
# note, not using '-s' due to broken openpgp
git push origin â€”tags
# git push origin master --tags

There are times when you want to remove tags as well. This quite easy:
git tag -d tag_name

To remove a tag on a remote repository, you should do a special push:
git push origin :refs/tags/tag_name
for github try:
git push origin :v0.0.2
