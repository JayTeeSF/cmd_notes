# for a Rails ActionController:TestCase
test "get ab_experiments" do
 ...
end
# the following worked for one of my projects:
bundle exec ruby -I"lib:test" test/functional/mobile_controller_test.rb -n "test_get_ab_experiments"

# using rake (with/without bundle exec) may work
# though:
bundle exec rake test test/functional/mobile_controller_test.rb -n test_get_ab_experiments
# failed for me because rake was processing the "-n" option (vs. test-unit processing it).

# instead I tried the following -- but that seemed to run the full test-suite... (probably need to use the TEST= variable approach...
bundle exec rake test test/functional/mobile_controller_test.rb -- -n test_get_ab_experiments

# finally, this seems to work:
bundle exec rake test test/functional/mobile_controller_test.rb
