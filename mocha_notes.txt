want to expect a list of params ...in any order (w/ old version of mocha):
# note: this may be possible w/ a more condensed notation, I just didn't have time to try that yet:

Model.expects(:find).with(all_of(*@model_instance_ids.map{|i| includes(i)})).at_least_once.returns(@model_instance_vals)

The above says:
I'm expecting the code_under_test to call "Model.find" and pass it an array of ids (in any order)
The result, is to return my list of model_instance_values (which are likely "mocks")
